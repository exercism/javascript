# Concurrency

> [!NOTE]
> When people hear the word _concurrency_ they often think of _parallelism_, a related but quite distinct concept.<br>
> In programming, concurrency is the _composition_ of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the<br> > _simultaneous execution_ of (possibly related) computations.<br> > [Concurrency is not parallelism](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)
