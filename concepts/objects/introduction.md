# Introduction

## Explanation

Besides primitive data types like `number` and `string`, there is another important data type in JavaScript called `object`.
Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
As such, they can be used as what is often referred to as maps or dictionaries in other languages.

In other languages, all values in a map often need to have the same data type.
In JavaScript, only the type of the key is restricted: it has to be a string.
The values inside one object can have different types.
They can be primitive types like numbers but also arrays, other objects or even functions.
This makes objects very versatile so that they are also key entities for [object-oriented programming][oop] (OOP) in JavaScript.

In the following, we will focus on objects as collections or maps. Other use cases of objects will be covered in other concepts, see e.g., [Classes][concept-classes].

## Creating an Object

You create an object using curly brackets.
You can also directly include some entries.
For that, state the key first, followed by a colon and the value.

```javascript
const emptyObject = {};

const obj = {
  favoriteNumber: 42,
  greeting: 'Hello World',
  useGreeting: true,
  address: {
    street: 'Trincomalee Highway',
    city: 'Batticaloa',
  },
  fruits: ['melon', 'papaya'],
  addNumbers: function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
};
```

The trailing comma after the last entry is optional in JavaScript.

You might wonder why the keys are not wrapped in quotation marks although they are supposed to be strings.
This is a short-hand notation.
If the key follows the naming rules for a JavaScript [identifier][mdn-identifier], you can omit the quotation marks.
For keys with special characters in the name, you need to use the usual string notation.

```javascript
const obj = {
  '1keyStartsWithNumber': '...',
  'key/with/slashes': '...',
  'key-with-dashes': '...',
  'key with spaces': '...',
  '#&()[]{}èä樹keyWithSpecialChars': '...',
};
```

## Retrieving a Value

There are two ways to retrieve the value for a given key, dot notation and bracket notation.

```javascript
const obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };

obj.greeting;
// => hello world

obj['greeting'];
// => hello world

// Bracket notation also works with variables.
const key = 'greeting';
obj[key];
// => hello world
```

Using the dot notation as a shorthand has the same restriction as omitting the quotation marks.
It only works if the key follows the identifier naming rules.
In other words, if your key is not a single word using only letters, you must use square bracket notation.

## Adding or Changing a Value

You can add or change a value using the assignment operator `=`.
Again, there are dot and bracket notations available.

```javascript
const obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };

obj.greeting = 'Hi there!';
obj['greeting'] = 'Welcome.';

obj.newKey1 = 'new value 1';
obj['new key 2'] = 'new value 2';

const key = 'new key 3';
obj[key] = 'new value 3';
```

## Deleting an Entry

You can delete a key-value pair from an object using the `delete` keyword.

```javascript
const obj = {
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2',
};

delete obj.key1;
delete obj['key2'];
```

## Checking Whether a Key Exists

You can check whether a certain key exists in an object with the `hasOwnProperty` method.

```javascript
const obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };

obj.hasOwnProperty('greeting');
// => true

obj.hasOwnProperty('age');
// => false
```

## Looping Through an Object

There is a special `for...in` loop to iterate over all keys of an object.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Ali',
  age: 65,
};

for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
}
// name Ali
// age 65
```

To avoid subtle errors you should always assume the `for...in` loop visits the keys in an arbitrary order.
Also, be aware that `for...in` includes [inherited keys][concept-inheritance] in its iteration.
