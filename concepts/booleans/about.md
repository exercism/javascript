# About

JavaScript uses `true` and `false` to represent the two truth values of logic.

In JavaScript, for each of the three logical operations (AND, OR and NOT) there is a corresponding operator: `&&`, `||` and `!`.
In general, there are rules regarding the order of the operations and, in this case, `!` (negation) is applied first, and then `&&` (conjunction) and then `||` (disjunction).

The order of operations between the operators can be overcome by using an operator with an even higher precedence: `( )`, named the 'Grouping operator' or simply said 'parentheses'.
As a matter of fact, the `( )` operator has the highest precedence of all JavaScript operators.
More information about operators precedence found [here].
