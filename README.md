**Exercism exercises in JavaScript**

This is the JavaScript track, one of the many tracks on [Exercism][web-exercism].
It holds all the _exercises_ that are currently implemented and available for students to complete.
The track consists of various **concept** exercises that teach the [JavaScript syllabus][web-syllabus], and various practice exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus and can be used to practice concepts learned.
You can find this in the [`config.json`][file-config].

## Tools

See [CONTRIBUTING.md][file-contributing] for a list of requirements to contribute to this track.
It also has a list of tools you can use, of which the `test` tool is one of them.

## Running the code quality tooling (linter)

This run `eslint` for all files that _require_ linting.

```shell
corepack pnpm node scripts/lint.mjs --fix
```

These are also the files that are linted using the lint script, mentioned in [CONTRIBUTING.md][file-contributing].
The lint rules imposed on contributors and maintainers are stricter than those for the student.
The idea is that we do **not** impose style rules on the students, but we guard for (potential) errors.

Files with strict rules:

- `<slug>.spec.js`
- `.meta/proof.ci.js`
- `.meta/exemplar.js`

Files with loose rules:

- `custom.spec.js`
- `<slug>.js`

## Running the test suite

This runs `jest` tests for all sample solutions.
This _does not_ use the regular way to run `jest`, because the example solution files must be renamed to be imported correctly into the test files.

```shell
corepack pnpm node scripts/test.mjs
```

If the `ASSIGNMENT` environment variable is set, only _that_ exercise is tested.
For example, if you only want to test the `example.js` for the practice exercise `two-fer`, you may, depending on your environment, use:

```shell
ASSIGNMENT=practice/two-fer corepack pnpm node scripts/test.mjs
```

> Running on Windows? Depending on your shell, environment variables are set differently.
> You can use `cross-env` to normalize this. The following should work across environments:
>
> ```bash
> # if installed globally
> cross-env ASSIGNMENT=practice/two-fer corepack pnpm node scripts/test.mjs
>
> # otherwise
> corepack pnpm dlx cross-env ASSIGNMENT=practice/two-fer node scripts/test.mjs
> ```
