# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Javascript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation)

## Requirements

Please `cd` into exercise directory before running all below commands.

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.


## Submitting Solutions

Once you have a solution ready, you can submit it using:

```bash
exercism submit rna-transcription.js
```

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
