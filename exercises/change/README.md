# Change

Correctly determine the change to be given using the least number of coins.

The solution will need to accept a value of change to be given and an array of
coin denominations.   The program returns the array of coin denominations to
produce the correct amount of change.  For example, if change for 37 cents  
is required from coins with the denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 25 then the
result is an array with the values: 1, 1, 10 and 25.

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suite, all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by
changing `xtest` to `test`.
