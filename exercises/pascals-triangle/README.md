Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to
the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.
