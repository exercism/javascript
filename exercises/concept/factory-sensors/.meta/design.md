# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to handle errors / exception, throw them and create their own.

## Learning objectives

- throw Error
- try {} catch {}
- instanceOf SpecialError
- Creating custom errors
  - Prefilling a message
  - Constructing a message based on some constructor value
  - Storing constructor values on the error (so that you have context)

## Out of scope

- Promise rejection
- Throwing non-errors

## Concepts

- `errors`
- `inheritance`

## Prerequisites

- `classes` to understand how to create errors
- `conditionals` because they are needed for the exercise
- `null-undefined` because they are needed for the exercise
