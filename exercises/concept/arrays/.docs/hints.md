### 1. Retrieve a card from a stack

- Array indices start at `0`. 
- [This page][access_array_elements_resource] has more information on how to access array elements.

### 2. Exchange a card in the stack

- The array is a mutable structure, you can change its content anytime. 
- You can find an example [here][change_array_elements_resource], inside the 'Changing an Array Element' section.

### 3. Create a stack of cards

- There is a [built-in][push_method_docs] method to add a new value to the end of the array.
 
### 4. Remove a card from the stack

- There is a [built-in][splice_method_docs] method that, among other use cases, can be used to remove elements starting at a certain position.

### 5. Remove the top card from the stack

- There is a [built-in][pop_method_docs] method to remove the last element from the array.

### 6. Check size of the stack

- Arrays have a [property][length_property_docs] to retrieve their length.
