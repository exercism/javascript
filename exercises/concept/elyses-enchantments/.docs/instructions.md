# Instructions

As a magician-to-be, Elyse needs to practice some basics. She has
a stack of cards that she wants to manipulate.

To make things a bit easier she only uses the cards 1 to 10 so her
stack of cards can be represented by an array of numbers. The position
of a certain card corresponds to the index in the array. That means
position 0 refers to the first card, position 1 to the second card
etc.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
~~~~exercism/note
All functions should update the array of cards and then return the modified array - a common way of working known as the Builder pattern, which allows you to nicely daisy-chain functions together.

## 1. Retrieve a card from a stack

To pick a card, return the card at index `position` from
the given stack.

```javascript
const position = 2;
getItem([1, 2, 4, 1], position);
// => 4
```

## 2. Exchange a card in the stack

Perform some sleight of hand and exchange the card at index `position`
with the replacement card provided.
Return the adjusted stack.

```javascript
const position = 2;
const replacementCard = 6;
setItem([1, 2, 4, 1], position, replacementCard);
// => [1, 2, 6, 1]
```

## 3. Insert a card at the top of the stack

Make a card appear by inserting a new card at the top of the stack.
Return the adjusted stack.

```javascript
const newCard = 8;
insertItemAtTop([5, 9, 7, 1], newCard);
// => [5, 9, 7, 1, 8]
```

## 4. Remove a card from the stack

Make a card disappear by removing the card at the given `position` from the stack.
Return the adjusted stack.

```javascript
const position = 2;
removeItem([3, 2, 6, 4, 8], position);
// => [3, 2, 4, 8]
```

## 5. Remove the top card from the stack

Make a card disappear by removing the card at the top of the stack.
Return the adjusted stack.

```javascript
removeItemFromTop([3, 2, 6, 4, 8]);
// => [3, 2, 6, 4]
```

## 6. Insert a card at the bottom of the stack

Make a card appear by inserting a new card at the bottom of the stack.
Return the adjusted stack.

```javascript
const newCard = 8;
insertItemAtBottom([5, 9, 7, 1], newCard);
// => [8, 5, 9, 7, 1]
```

## 7. Remove a card from the bottom of the stack

Make a card disappear by removing the card at the bottom of the stack.
Return the adjusted stack.

```javascript
removeItemAtBottom([8, 5, 9, 7, 1]);
// => [5, 9, 7, 1]
```

## 8. Check the size of the stack

Check whether the size of the stack is equal to `stackSize` or not.

```javascript
const stackSize = 4;
checkSizeOfStack([3, 2, 6, 4, 8], stackSize);
// => false
```
