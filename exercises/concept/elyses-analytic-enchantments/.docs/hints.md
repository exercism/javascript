# Hints

## 1. Find the position of a card

- Array indices starts at `0`.
- There is a [built-in][indexof_method_docs] method to get given value index.

## 2. Determine if a card is present

- There is a [built-in][includes_method_docs] method to check whether the value is present in the array

## 3. Determine if each card is even

- There is a [built-in][every_method_docs] method to check if each value passes a predicate

## 4. Check if the stack contains an odd-value card

- There is a [built-in][some_method_docs] method to check if at least one value passes a predicate

## 5. Get the first odd card from the stack

- There is a [built-in][find_method_docs] method to get the first item that passes a predicate

## 6. Determine the position of the first card that is even

- There is a [built-in][findindex_method_docs] method to get the first index in array that the value
