# Hints

## 1. Get the first card

- [This article][mdn-destructuring] has a good overview of array destructuring. You can find an example of basic variable assignment in the 'Basic Array Destructuring' section.

## 2. Get the second card

- You can use placeholders to ignore one or more values in the array.
- You can find an example [on MDN][mdn-destructuring-ignore-value].

## 3. Swap the two cards

- It's possible to swap two values in a single destructuring expression.
- You can find an example [on MDN][mdn-destructuring-swapping].

## 4. Shift three cards around

- It's possible to change the position of three values in a single destructuring expression.
- This is the same as swapping two values, but then with three (or more).

## 5. Pick named pile

- Objects can be destructured just like arrays.
- You can find an example [on MDN][mdn-object-destructuring-basic-assignment].

## 6. Swap named piles

- When a property is extracted from an object, it can be renamed using specific syntax.
- You can find an example [on MDN][mdn-object-destructuring-object-rename].
