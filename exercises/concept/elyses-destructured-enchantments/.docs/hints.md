# Hints

## 1. Get the first card

- [This article][destructuring_overview_resource] has a good overview of array destructuring. You can find an example of basic variable assignment in the 'Basic Array Destructuring' section.

## 2. Get the second card

- You can use placeholders to ignore one or more values in the array.
- You can find an example [here][ignoring_some_values_resource].

## 3. Swap the first two cards

- It's possible to swap two values in a single destructuring expression.
- You can find an example [here][swapping_variables_resource].

## 4. Discard the top card

- There is a [built-in][rest_operator_docs] operator that can be used to collect the remaining values in an array into a single variable.
- You can find an example [here][rest_assignment_resource].

## 5. Insert face cards

- There is a [built-in][spread_operator_docs] operator that can be used to expand an array into a list.
- You can find a more detailed overview [here][spread_operator_overview].
