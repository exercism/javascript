# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how _callbacks_ are implemented in `JavaScript`.

In other words: how _function_ can be passed as an argument to another function, then have them be called in order to control the flow of logic.

## Learning objectives

- Function that can pass along a callback function as an argument
- How to write a function that can be used as a callback
- How to compose functions with callbacks

## Out of scope

- Promises
- Asynchronicity

## Concepts

- `callbacks`

## Prerequisites

- `functions` because they are the base for understanding arrow functions
- `objects` because they are needed for the exercise
