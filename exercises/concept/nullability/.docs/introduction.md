## nullability

The `null` value in Javascript represents the intentional absence of an object value. It is one of Javascript's primitive types.

```javascript
// I do not have an apple.
var apple = null
apple // => null

// null is treated as falsy for boolean operations, therefore
!apple // => true
!!apple // => false
```
