# Design

## Learning objectives

- Using spread to turn an array into a list of parameters
- Using rest elements to turn a list of parameters into an array
- Using spread to turn an extract value out of an object
- Using spread to combine objects
- Using rest to collect multiple parameters into an array

## Out of scope

- Default values

## Concepts

- `rest-and-spread`

## Prerequisites

- `arrays` are needed to understand array restructuring
- `functions` are needed as basis for rest parameters
- `objects` are needed for object spread etc.
- `array-destructuring` are needed to understand rest elements
