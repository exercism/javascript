# Introduction

JavaScript has a built-in `...` operator that makes it easier to work with indefinite numbers of elements. Depending on the context, it's called either a _rest operator_ or _spread operator_.

## Rest operator

### Rest elements

When `...` appears on the left-hand side of an assignment, those three dots are known as the `rest` operator. The three dots together with a variable name is called a rest element. It collects zero or more values, and stores them into a single array.

```javascript
const [a, b, ...everythingElse] = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
a;
// => 0
b;
// => 1
everythingElse;
// => [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

Note that in JavaScript, unlike some other languages, a `rest` element cannot have a trailing comma. It _must_ be the last element in a destructuring assignment. The example below throws a `SyntaxError`:

```javascript
const [...items, last] = [2, 4, 8, 16]
```

### Rest properties

Similarly to arrays, the rest operator can also be used to collect one or more object properties and store them in a single object.

```javascript
const { street, ...address } = {
  street: 'Platz der Republik 1',
  postalCode: '11011',
  city: 'Berlin',
};
street;
// => 'Platz der Republik 1'
address;
// => {postalCode: '11011', city: 'Berlin'}
```

## Rest parameters

When `...` appears in a function definition next to its last argument, that parameter is called a _rest parameter_. It allows the function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

```javascript
function concat(...strings) {
  return strings.join(' ');
}
concat('one');
// => 'one'
concat('one', 'two', 'three');
// => 'one two three'
```

## Spread

### Spread elements

When `...` appears on the right-hand side of an assignment, it's known as the `spread` operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.

```javascript
const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const oneToTen = [...oneToFive, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
oneToTen;
// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
const woow = ['A', ...oneToFive, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', ...oneToFive, 42];
woow;
// =>  ["A", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "B", "C", "D", "E", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 42]
```

### Spread properties

Similarly to arrays, the spread operator can also be used to copy properties from one object to another.

```javascript
let address = {
  postalCode: '11011',
  city: 'Berlin',
};
address = { ...address, country: 'Germany' };
// => {
//   postalCode: '11011',
//   city: 'Berlin',
//   country: 'Germany',
// }
```
