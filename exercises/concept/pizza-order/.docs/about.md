### About Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for breaking down problems that can be divided into smaller, similar sub-problems. However, recursion can quickly run into issues such as **Memory Allocation Errors** or **Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded** if not handled carefully.

In JavaScript, one important limitation is the **lack of Tail-Call Optimization (TCO)**. Tail-call optimization allows the language engine to reuse the stack frame for recursive calls when they occur at the end of a function. Unfortunately, JavaScript does not support TCO, which means that deeply nested recursive calls can lead to a stack overflow.

### Interesting Facts:
- Recursion is widely used in problems such as tree traversal, factorial calculation, and Fibonacci sequences.
- JavaScript does not optimize tail calls, unlike other languages such as Scheme or Haskell.
