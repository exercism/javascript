# Hints

## 1. Find the sum of two arrays

- There is a built-in function to join the `array` and convert it to a string doing the implicit type conversion to make it string
- There is built in object which is explicitly used to convert the `string` to the `number`
- Sum the result once each number is converted

## 2. Determine if the number is lucky

- There is a prototype which explicit convert the number to `string`
- There is a function which can convert the `string` to the `array`.
- There is a function on the `array` constructor which can reverse the number of elements in your array
- First convert the number into the string and then convert it into array and calculate the reverse of it and join the array and finally compare the two string

## 3. Dashify the number

- Use type conversion to change the number to a string
- Strings have methods which can be used to break them apart
- Arrays have a method to merge elements into a string
