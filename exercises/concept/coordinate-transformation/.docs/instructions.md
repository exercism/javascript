# Instructions

Your design company has primarily been working with CSS transformations to build web pages. After some discussion, a decision is made
to start using JavaScript to perform some calculations dynamically. Some of your teammates are less experienced with JavaScript,
so you decide to use a function closure to create reusable transformation for `{x, y}` coordinate pairs.

## 1. Translate the coordinates

Implement the `translate2d` function that returns a function making use of a closure to perform a repeatable 2d translation of a coordinate pair.

> In Geometry, [translation][wiki-translate] refers to moving points, vectors or shapes the same distance in one direction.
> It can be interpreted as addition of a constant to every point.

```javascript
const moveCoordinatesRight2Px = translate2d(2, 0);
const result = moveCoordinatesRight2Px(4, 8);
// result => [6, 8]
```

## 2. Scale the coordinates

Implement the `scale2d` function that returns a function making use of a closure to perform a repeatable 2d scale of a coordinate pair.

> In geometry, uniform [scaling][wiki-scale] refers to enlarging or shrinking vectors or shapes in the same direction.
> It can be interpreted as multiplying every point by a constant (scaling factor).
>
> For this exercise, assume only positive scaling values.

```javascript
const doubleScale = scale2d(2, 2);
const result = doubleScale(6, -3);
// result => [12, -6]
```

## 3. Compose transformation functions

Combine two transformation functions to perform a repeatable transformation. This is often called _function composition_, where the result of the first function _'f(x)'_ is used as the input to the second function _'g(x)'_.

```javascript
const moveCoordinatesRight2Px = translate2d(2, 0);
const doubleCoordinates = scale2d(2, 2);
const composedTransformations = composeTransform(
  moveCoordinatesRight2Px,
  doubleCoordinates,
);
const result = composedTransformations(0, 1);
// result => [4, 2]
```

## 4. Save the results of functions

Implement the `memoizeTransform` function. It takes a function to _memoize_, then returns a new function that remembers the inputs to the supplied function so that the last return value can be "remembered" and only calculated once if it is called again with the same arguments.

> Memoizing is sometimes used in _dynamic programming_.
> It allows for expensive operations to be done only once since their results are remembered.
> **Note** that in this exercise only the last result is remembered, unlike some solutions in dynamic programming that memoize _all_ results.

```javascript
const tripleScale = scale2d(3, 3);
const memoizedScale = memoizeTransform(tripleScale);

memoizedScale(4, 3); // => [12, 9], this is computed since it hasn't been computed before for the arguments
memoizedScale(4, 3); // => [12, 9], this is remembered, since it was computed already
```
