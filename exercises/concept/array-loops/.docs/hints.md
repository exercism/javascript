## 1. Determine how many cards of a certain type are in the deck

- Try using `forEach` and an integer variable to loop over the array, increasing the variable each round to increase the count.

## 2. Determine if there are any unique cards

- You can store the counts of each type of card in an object or array, through looping over the deck. At the end, you can compare those counts; any card that only has one occurrence will be unique!

- ## 3. Determine how many odd or even cards there are

Try using the modulo `%` operator to compare the parity of each card in the stack.
