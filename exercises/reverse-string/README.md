Reverse a string

For example:
input: "cool"

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Javascript to
install the necessary dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by
changing `xtest` to `test`.
