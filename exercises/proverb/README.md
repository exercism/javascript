# Proverb

"For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost" is a popular proverb. There are may variations
of this proverb and these variations can be chained together. For example:

> For want of a nail the shoe was lost.  
> For want of a shoe the horse was lost.  
> For want of a horse the rider was lost.  
> For want of a rider the message was lost.  
> For want of a message the battle was lost.  
> For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.  
> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.

Given two or more nouns, construct the full chain of events for the above proverb.
For example, given the nouns "nail", "shoe" and "horse", your program should output the text:

>For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
>For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
>And all for the want of a nail.

Given the nouns, "nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message",  and a qualifier "horseshoe", your program should output:

> For want of a nail the shoe was lost.  
> For want of a shoe the horse was lost.  
> For want of a horse the rider was lost.  
> For want of a rider the message was lost. 
> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
