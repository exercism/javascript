# Matching Brackets

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`,
or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
and nested correctly.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Javascript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.
