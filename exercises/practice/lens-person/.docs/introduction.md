In JavaScript, lenses are a functional programming concept that allows you to access and modify data in a modular and immutable way. They are essentially composable pairs of pure getter and setter functions that focus on a particular field inside an object.

Lenses can be used to simplify code, make it more reusable, and avoid common programming errors. For example, lenses can be used to:

- Access and modify nested data structures without having to worry about the specific structure of the data.
- Update data in a pure way, without mutating the original object.
- Compose multiple lenses together to create more complex lenses that can access and modify data in a variety of ways.
